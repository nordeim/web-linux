# AI Agent Briefing: UbuntuOS Web

This document provides high-signal technical context for AI coding agents. It focuses on non-obvious architectural patterns and state management quirks.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

### Window Manager (Logic: `useOSStore.tsx`)
- **Z-Index Stacking**: Focus management is handled by a global `nextZIndex`. To focus a window, dispatch `FOCUS_WINDOW`, which increments this counter. **Never manually set z-index in CSS.**
- **Window States**: `normal`, `minimized`, `maximized`. Restoring from maximized uses `prevPosition` and `prevSize` stored in the window object.
- **Cascading**: New windows are offset by 30px from the last window of the same app type using the `createWindow` helper.

### Safe Evaluator (`safeEval.ts`)
> **MANDATORY**: All math evaluation (spreadsheet formulas, terminal `calc`) must use `safeEval()` from `@/utils/safeEval`. This replaces `eval()` and `new Function()` with a hardened shunting-yard parser.
> - **Guideline**: Any new app doing math must import and use `safeEval(expr: string): number`
> - **Bug fix of**: `Spreadsheet.tsx` and `Terminal.tsx` previously used `eval()` and `new Function()` — both removed.

### XSS Sanitization (`sanitizeHtml.ts`)
> **MANDATORY**: Any `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` must wrap content in `sanitizeHtml()` from `@/utils/sanitizeHtml`.
> - **Markdown**: Use `sanitizeMarkdownHtml()` which has a whitelist for common markdown tags.
> - **Bug fix of**: `Notes.tsx`, `MarkdownPreview.tsx`, `RegexTester.tsx`, and `CodeEditor.tsx` all previously rendered raw HTML without sanitization.

### Virtual File System (Logic: `useFileSystem.ts`)
- **ID-Based**: Nodes are referenced by unique IDs, not paths. Use `findNodeByPath(path)` only when resolving a user-provided string.
- **Persistence**: The VFS is synced to `localStorage` under `ubuntuos_filesystem`.
- **Associations**: `FILE_ASSOCIATIONS` in `useFileSystem.ts` maps extensions to `appId` and icons. Update this to register new file types.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Adding a New App
1.  **Component**: Create `src/apps/YourApp.tsx`.
2.  **Registry**: Add entry to `src/apps/registry.ts`. This defines the app category, default size, and icon.
3.  **Router**: Register the `appId` in `src/apps/AppRouter.tsx`.
4.  **Icons**: Use `Lucide React` names in the registry.

### Common Commands
Run from the `app/` directory:
- `npm run dev`: Start Vite dev server.
- `npm run build`: Type-check (`tsc`) and build.
- `npm run lint`: ESLint check.

## ⚠️ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Direct DOM Manipulation**: Avoid `document.getElementById` for window operations. Use the `OSAction` dispatches.
- **Path-Based VFS Calls**: Do not assume a file's path is its unique identifier. Always use the node `id`.
- **Custom Window Chrome**: Do not build custom title bars or resize handles in individual apps. `WindowFrame.tsx` provides the standardized shell.
- **Bypassing the Store**: App-to-app communication should go through the `useOS` hook or the File System, not local props.

## 🔗 Key Entry Points
- `src/hooks/useOSStore.tsx`: Global OS state and reducer.
- `src/hooks/useFileSystem.ts`: VFS logic and associations.
- `src/apps/AppRouter.tsx`: Central component mapping for windows.
