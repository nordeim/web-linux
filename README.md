A comprehensive, high-fidelity web-based replica of the Ubuntu Linux desktop environment. This project delivers a fully interactive experience in the browser, featuring a window manager, virtual file system, and 54 functional applications.

## 🌟 Overview

UbuntuOS Web solves the challenge of creating a complex, component-based desktop experience in a web environment. It demonstrates the power of modern React by managing a multi-windowed UI with a custom z-index stacking system and a virtualized file system (VFS) that persists data locally.

Built for developers as a showcase of architectural patterns and for users as a portable, web-accessible toolset.

## 🛡️ Recent Security & Reliability Improvements

This codebase has undergone multiple comprehensive security audits and remediations. Key fixes include:

### dpsk-2 Security & Reliability Remediation (2026-06-02)
- **Eliminated Arbitrary Code Execution**: Replaced `eval()` (Spreadsheet) and `new Function()` (Terminal) with a hardened shunting-yard math parser.
- **Fixed XSS Vulnerabilities**: All `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` instances now wrap content in `DOMPurify`-based sanitization.
- **Added localStorage Schema Validation**: Prevents data corruption by validating all persisted state with `zod` at runtime. Introduced the `safeJsonParse(raw, schema, fallback)` utility for app-specific validation.
- **Fixed Z-Index Overflow**: Added bounds checking to prevent focus stacking issues in long sessions.
- **Resolved Fragile Reduce Logic**: Fixed window state restoration logic to prevent crashes when minimizing all windows.
- **Eliminated 43 Build Errors from Dead Code**: Fixed all `TS6133` errors (unused locals/parameters) across 16 files, ensuring clean production builds.
- **Fixed ReDoS in RegexTester**: Added execution iteration limit (1000) to prevent catastrophic backtracking from freezing the browser tab.
- **Fixed Calculator Factorial Memory Crash**: Added input cap at 170 to prevent `Array.from({length: v})` from allocating massive arrays.
- **Refactored RegexTester Rendering**: Replaced `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with React component-based match highlighting to eliminate XSS risk.
- **Fixed Misleading Recording Extensions**: Changed `.webm` to `.txt` for ScreenRecorder and VoiceRecorder simulated downloads.
- **Fixed Calculator Keyboard Stale Closures**: Added all handler functions to `useEffect` dependency array to prevent stale closure bugs.
- **Fixed WindowFrame Wildcard Import**: Replaced `import * as Icons from 'lucide-react'` with named imports (`Minus`, `Copy`, `Square`, `X`), saving ~587 KB of bundle bloat per chunk.
- **Fixed MINIMIZE_ALL Losing Window Positions**: `MINIMIZE_ALL` now captures `prevPosition` and `prevSize` before minimizing, matching the behavior of `MINIMIZE_WINDOW`.
- **Exported sanitizeMarkdownHtml from Utils**: `sanitizeMarkdownHtml()` was local to `MarkdownPreview.tsx` but is now properly exported from `@/utils/sanitizeHtml` for reuse across apps.
- **Removed Dead Commented Import from Desktop.tsx**: Cleaned up a commented `import * as Icons from 'lucide-react'` line that violated build hygiene.
- **Corrected Stale Documentation Line Counts**: Updated osReducer line count from "499-line" to "approximately 350 lines" across all documentation files.
- **Added GlobalErrorBoundary Around AppShell**: The `AppShell` component (boot, login, keyboard handlers) is now wrapped in `GlobalErrorBoundary`, preventing shell-level errors from crashing the entire OS.

### dpsk-2 Phase 1: localStorage Validation Complete (2026-06-03)
- **Replaced raw `JSON.parse` in 15 apps**: All apps (`ArchiveManager`, `Calculator`, `Calendar`, `Chat`, `Clock`, `ColorPalette`, `ColorPicker`, `Memory`, `Notes`, `Reminders`, `RssReader`, `ScreenRecorder`, `Settings`, `Spreadsheet`, `TextEditor`) now use `safeJsonParse(raw, schema, fallback)` instead of unvalidated `JSON.parse` for localStorage reads.
- **Zero remaining raw `JSON.parse` on localStorage**: Final verification confirms no apps use unvalidated localStorage reads.

### dpsk-2 Phase 2: Accessibility & Documentation (2026-06-03)
- **Added ARIA attributes to core components**: Added `aria-label`, `role`, `tabIndex` to `Dock.tsx`, `WindowFrame.tsx`, and `Desktop.tsx` interactive elements.
- **Added keyboard focus styles**: Global `:focus-visible` and `:focus:not(:focus-visible)` CSS rules in `index.css` for keyboard accessibility.
- **Added automated accessibility source tests**: 14 tests verify ARIA attribute presence in component source files.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology | Version | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React | 19.2.0 | Component-based UI & Hook-based logic |
| **Language** | TypeScript | 5.9.3 | Strict type safety across the OS store |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | 3.4.19 | Utility-first design with Ubuntu tokens |
| **Components** | Radix UI / Shadcn | Latest | Accessible primitive components |
| **Icons** | Lucide React | 0.562.0 | Vector iconography for apps and UI |
| **Storage** | LocalStorage | N/A | Persistence for the Virtual File System |
| **Security** | DOMPurify | 3.4.7 | XSS sanitization for user-generated HTML |
| **Validation** | Zod | 4.3.5 | Runtime schema validation for persistence |
| **Testing** | Vitest | 4.x | Unit tests for utils and components |

### Core Systems
1.  **Window Manager:** A custom engine in `src/components/WindowFrame.tsx` handling dragging, resizing, focus management, and state transitions (min/max/restore).
2.  **OS Store:** Centralized state management using React Context + `useReducer` to sync the Dock, Desktop, and Windows.
3.  **Virtual File System (VFS):** A robust file management layer with associations, trash handling, and directory traversal. Data is persisted to `localStorage` and validated with `zod` schemas.

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Recommendations

1. **VFS localStorage Limit**: The virtual file system uses `localStorage`, which has a ~5 MB limit. For large file storage, consider migrating to IndexedDB.
2. **Accessibility - Remaining Work**: Core shell components (Dock, WindowFrame, Desktop) now have ARIA labels. Games and media apps may still need keyboard navigation and ARIA labels. Run a Lighthouse accessibility audit for details.
3. **Split osReducer**: The `osReducer` is approximately 350 lines and handles window, dock, notification, context menu, icon, theme, and alt-tab logic. Now `export`ed for testing. Consider splitting into domain-specific reducers.
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build + lint + test gates are not yet implemented.
5. **Unused Local / Import Hygiene**: The `tsconfig.app.json` enforces `"noUnusedLocals": true` and `"noUnusedParameters": true`. Prior build broke with 43 `TS6133` errors across 16 files. Keep imports lean and remove dead code promptly to prevent build regressions.
6. **ReDoS from User-Crafted Regex**: RegexTester now limits iterations, but apps accepting user regex (e.g., Notes search, Email filters) should also guard against catastrophic backtracking.
7. **Simulated vs Real Recordings**: ScreenRecorder and VoiceRecorder create placeholder text downloads. Production builds should implement actual `MediaRecorder` API recording or clearly mark as simulated.
8. **GlobalErrorBoundary Around AppShell**: The `AppShell` component (boot, login, keyboard handlers) is now wrapped in `GlobalErrorBoundary` in `App.tsx`.
9. **Vitest @/ Alias Resolution**: Component tests using `@/` aliases fail in vitest due to module resolution issues. Currently, only utility tests (relative imports) pass consistently. Component-level tests use source-level validation as a workaround.
